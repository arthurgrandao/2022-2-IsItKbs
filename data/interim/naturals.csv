at

But
the
fact
is
I
was
and
so
gently
you
came
And
so
faintly
you
came

at

I
scarce
was

I
heard
I
opened
wide
the

there
and
nothing
Deep
into

ever

the
silence
was

nothing

into

within

again
I
heard
a
tapping
somewhat
louder
than
said
that
is
something
at

window

me
what

I
marvelled
this

fowl
to

we
cannot
help
agreeing
that
no

human
being

yet

blessed
with
